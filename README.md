HTML Structure:

The document starts with the standard HTML5 doctype declaration

The content is organized into semantic <section> elements for better structure

Each section has an appropriate heading level (h1 for main title, h2 for section titles)

CSS Styling:

Uses a clean sans-serif font (Arial) with good line spacing

Limited color palette with blue as the accent color

Responsive design with max-width constraint

The "Download My CV" link is styled as a button

Subtle hover effects for interactive elements

Content Organization:

Information is grouped logically into sections

Lists are used for items that naturally belong together (interests, projects)


Minimalist Approach:

No unnecessary decorative elements

Plenty of white space for readability

Simple, flat design without gradients or shadows
